# SENSE-Edge

**Sensor-to-Image Neuro-Symbolic & Vision–Language Framework for Explainable Environmental Intelligence on Edge Devices**

---

## 📌 Overview

SENSE-Edge is an **agentic, neuro-symbolic, and Vision–Language–driven framework** designed for real-time, explainable environmental monitoring on **edge devices**.

It introduces a novel **Sensor-to-Image Encoding** pipeline that transforms heterogeneous environmental sensor data (air, water, climate, indoor) into structured **visual representations** compatible with large vision models.

Unlike traditional time-series approaches, SENSE-Edge integrates:

- Sensor-to-Image data transformation  
- Vision–Language Model (VLM) perception  
- Neuro-symbolic reasoning & ontologies  
- Agentic autonomous decision-making  
- Edge-focused, low-power deployment  

The framework supports **explainable, trustworthy, and scalable environmental intelligence**, aligned with sustainable development and AI transparency principles.

## 🎯 Research Objectives

SENSE-Edge aims to:

- Convert heterogeneous sensor streams into meaningful **2D visual representations**  
  *(GAF, RP, Spectrograms, Heatmaps)*  
- Leverage **Vision–Language Models** (e.g., CLIP / ViT) for perception of synthetic sensor imagery  
- Integrate a **neuro-symbolic reasoning layer** using ontology + ASP logic  
- Enable **agentic, autonomous** monitoring and alert generation  
- Operate efficiently on **edge devices** (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson)  
- Provide **explainable decisions** for public and environmental stakeholders

### Three Main Logic Layers

- **Ontology Layer** – Defines environmental concepts, ranges, thresholds & relationships  
- **Reasoning Layer** – ASP-based probabilistic neuro-symbolic inference  
- **Agentic Layer** – Autonomous triggering, monitoring, action, explanation

## 🧪 Proof-of-Concept

Initial experiments were conducted using the **Beijing PM2.5 Dataset**:

- Sensor windows converted to visual form  
- Processed using an adapted **CLIP** model  
- Achieved **41% accuracy** on a **5-class** problem  
- Approaching published state-of-the-art (**~48.8%**)  

This demonstrates early feasibility of the vision-based method.
